# OCorpus Authorization Service

**Namespace**: `OCorpus.Authorization`  
**Project**: OCorpus Authorization Service

## Overview

The OCorpus Authorization Service is designed to provide a comprehensive authentication and authorization solution tailored for multiple organizations. It emphasizes security, flexibility, and scalability, ensuring that users have the appropriate access based on their roles and permissions.

### Key Features
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Supports multiple organizations while maintaining data isolation and security. Each organization can manage its own users, roles, and permissions without interference from other organizations.
- **Flexible Authentication Options**: Users can authenticate using various methods, including:
  - **Windows Login**: Seamless integration with Windows domain authentication for a smooth user experience.
  - **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Supports external login providers, enhancing user convenience and security.
  - **Active Directory (AD) Integration**: Allows organizations to leverage their existing AD infrastructure for user management and authentication.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Users are assigned roles that define their access rights within the system. This structure enables organizations to tailor access based on job responsibilities, ensuring that users only see and manage what they need.

- **Claims-Based Authorization**: Beyond roles, the service supports custom claims, allowing for finer-grained access control. This capability ensures that specific attributes can dictate user permissions.

- **Token-Based Authentication**: Utilizes JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure, stateless authentication, allowing easy management of user sessions and access control.

## Architecture

The OCorpus Authorization Service is built on a shared database model, designed to efficiently manage multiple organizations while ensuring data security and isolation. Each organizationâ€™s data is identified by unique identifiers, enabling a clear separation of roles, permissions, and user information.
